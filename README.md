# Hi there! 👋

My journey into programming has taken me through a rainbow of languages, starting with elementary school where I used JavaScript to create complex shape patterns and ending with the thrilling ID Tech Summer Camp. I've used Python for data magic, Java for reliable systems, JavaScript for web enchantment, Lua for game realms, and C# for pixel dreams. However, I don't stop there. I embrace the command line, working with Unix and Kali Linux and discovering mysteries in the mysterious syntax of the terminal. This coder's canvas paints a picture of limitless possibilities by combining logic and creativity. Together, let's carry on our adventure!
